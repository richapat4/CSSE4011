CSSE4011 Project

- [x] Select which radar module to use  
	- AWR1843 seems the best to use with I2C, UART, SPI interfaces. A111 is just SPI
- [ ] Select which board is best to use 
	- Could use Jetson -> program everything in python, runs machine learning on the board/ high speeds -> have no clue how it works
	- ESP32 can work just fine machine learning will have to be done on PC 
	- STM / can use Cube IDE 
- [ ] Ask about whether or not we need to program the AWR1843 radar module 
	- Probably not by the looks of it uses CLI interface ? not sure if this is just with the SDK
- [ ] Make sense of the CLI commands if the above is true

se the 3.3 / 3.5 versions 

There should be a demo folder with a bin file,
open up uniflash and flash the binary file onto the radar 

- Uniflash 
	- Make sure the radar is in flashing mode 
	- Make sure it's in SCP mode 5
